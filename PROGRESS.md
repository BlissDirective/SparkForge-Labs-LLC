# SparkForge Build Progress

## Current Phase: 3 — Stage 2 Parts 1-4 (Database & API)
## Status: NOT STARTED
## Last Updated: 2026-03-23 (D3D Overhaul Plan Complete)

### Local Development Environment Setup (March 21, 2026)

**Status:** COMPLETE
**Branch:** claude/sparkforge-stage1-foundation-LBQEo

**Environment:**
- Node.js v25.8.1, npm 11.11.0
- `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` — all dependencies installed
- `.env.local` — created with placeholder values (keys not yet configured)
- `npm run build` — compiles successfully (lint cleanup in progress)

**Note:** All prior code in this repo was written directly on GitHub (not built or tested locally). Local development begins now from Stage 1 Phase 1. The project is at **0% built/developed** — no stages have been locally validated or run.

### Discrepancies Log (March 22, 2026)

**Phase 1 fixes:**
- `next.config.js` → `next.config.ts`: Replaced Stage 10 production config with Stage 1 starter per build order. Added Sentry wrapper, GLSL loaders, Turbopack rules.
- `.gitignore`: Added missing test/Sentry entries (test-results/, playwright-report/, blob-report/, .sentryclirc).
- Created 8 missing directories: public/images, public/sounds/cockpit, public/fonts, public/models/pets, tests/unit, tests/integration, tests/e2e, tests/mocks.

**Phase 2 fixes:**
- `src/types/index.ts`: Added missing CPA v2.0 types (CockpitSkin, SpatialView, ConsoleType, CeremonyType, HUDDataMode, CameraTarget, HexClusterData).
- `src/lib/animations.ts`: Fixed import from `framer-motion` to `motion/react` per Enhancement 8.1.
- Created 5 missing files: `src/stores/cockpitAtoms.ts`, `src/lib/3d/webgpuDetect.ts`, `src/hooks/useAdaptiveCockpit.ts`, `vitest.config.ts`, `tests/setup.ts`.

### Desktop-First 3D Overhaul (D3D) — March 23, 2026

**Status:** PLAN COMPLETE (4 parts, 20 decision locks, 13 files)
**Branch:** `claude/3d-immersive-overhaul-plan-JyUZL`

| Part | Commit | Files | Decision Locks | Status |
|------|--------|-------|----------------|--------|
| A — Foundation Cleanup | `db18293` | 1 doc | D3D-1 through D3D-9 (9) | COMMITTED |
| B — Single Canvas & Iris | `93cd13e` | 4 src + 1 doc | D3D-B1 through D3D-B6 (6) | COMMITTED |
| C — Post-FX & Audio | `d923968` | 4 src + 1 doc | D3D-C1 through D3D-C5 (5) | COMMITTED |
| D — Doc Updates & Roadmap | — | 1 doc | 0 | IN PROGRESS |

**Source files created (8):**
- `src/stores/sceneStore.ts` — Centralized scene management
- `src/components/3d/SceneRouter.tsx` — Scene group visibility controller
- `src/components/3d/MechanicalIris.tsx` — Signature iris transition (530 lines)
- `src/hooks/useIrisTransition.ts` — Transition orchestration hook
- `src/components/3d/PostProcessingStack.tsx` — 7 always-on effects
- `src/lib/audio/irisAudio.ts` — Iris procedural audio
- `src/hooks/useParallaxMouse.ts` — Mouse parallax tracking
- `src/hooks/useInteractiveSurface.ts` — Hover-reactive surfaces

**Modified files (3):**
- `src/components/3d/CockpitCanvas.tsx` — Persistent canvas, SceneRouter, removed CSS fallbacks
- `src/components/game/GameShell.tsx` — sceneStore integration
- `src/components/3d/CameraSystem.tsx` — Game camera mode

**Key architecture changes:**
- Single persistent R3F Canvas (never unmounts, even during gameplay)
- Mechanical iris transition replaces canvas unmount pattern
- sceneStore centralizes visibility (replaces fragmented uiStore.gameActive + cockpitStore.heroPhase)
- 7 post-processing effects always-on with scene-reactive multipliers
- Procedural iris audio (Web Audio API)
- Mouse parallax + interactive surface hooks
